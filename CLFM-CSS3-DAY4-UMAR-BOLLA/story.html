		<h1 id="story">HIS STORY</h1>
		<p>He began his career like most ordinary college grads: no money, no clear direction and what looked like a lifetime at a desk job as an accountant. What transpired instead was one of the greatest stories of American entrepreneurship and a $100 billion sportswear giant. This is the story of Nike Co-founder Phil Knight, who turned his crazy idea into reality. The 78-year-old is telling the story behind Nike for the first time in his new memoir, “Shoe Dog.”

		The idea for the athletic apparel giant “came from running track at Hayward Field in Oregon and out of the classroom at Stanford business school,” Knight said.

		A self-described “average mid-distance runner” on the track team, Phil “Buck” Knight watched as his track coach at University of Oregon, Bill Bowerman, tinkered with athletes’ running shoes and the immediate impact it made on their performance.
